# Data Engineering
This is a summary of my efforts in finding solutions for the tasks of the IBM Data Engineering Professional Specialization.

### In this specialization I worked with:
- Create, design and manage relational databases and apply database administration (DBA) concepts to RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and IBM Db2.
- Develop and execute SQL queries using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements, database functions, stored procedures, nested queries and JOIN.
- Demonstrate working knowledge of NoSQL and Big Data using MongoDB, Cassandra, Cloudant, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Spark SQL, Spark ML, Spark Streaming.
- Implement ETL and Data Pipelines with Bash, Airflow and Kafka; design, populate and implement data warehouses; create BI reports and interactive dashboards.
